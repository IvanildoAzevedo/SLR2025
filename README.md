This repository contains data collected and analyzed from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) study investigating how replication studies in Software Engineering address threats to the validity of original studies, examining how they are identified, discussed, and mitigated. It also explores the impact of these threats on the reliability and generalizability of results, as well as the strategies used to mitigate.

The artifacts are associated with the submitted paper **Reimagining Studies' Replication: A Validity-Driven Analysis of Threats in Empirical Software Engineering**.
