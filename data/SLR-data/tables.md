# Threats to Validity – Summary Tables

This page presents aggregated tables derived from the SLR dataset, offering a quantitative overview of how replication studies in Software Engineering report and address various types of Threats to Validity (TTVs). The data is organized by study method, replication type, publication year, and other relevant dimensions.



# Frequency of Reported Types of Validity Threats by Research Method

This table presents the number of times each type of TTV (Internal, External, Conclusion, and Construct) was reported, grouped by research method. It helps identify which methods are more prone to certain types of threats.

_Note: Replication study [Rep71] involved two distinct methods (experiment and survey), each with its own validity section. As a result, its data was counted twice to accurately reflect method-specific reporting, increasing the total from 83 to 84._
